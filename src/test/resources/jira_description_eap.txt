The Snowdrop team is pleased to inform you that we're planning to release a new Snowdrop BOM on *30 Jun 2021*
 based on Spring Boot *2.4.3*.

Some of our artifacts depend on your product and we need to know which product version we should be using for this new
 release.

While we don't require a new release of your product as long as the artifacts you provide us with are tested and supported
 on Spring Boot *2.4.3*, it's important that you let us know until when your product is supported so that we can plan
 future releases accordingly. For reference, we will support this new release until *31 Aug 2022*.

Thank you in advance for your help!
